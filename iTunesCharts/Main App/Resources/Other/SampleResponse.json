Name them, set group photos and keep them all in one place.\n\nPhotos and videos: Shoot videos and snap selfies or other photos right from the app and send them with one tap.\n\nFree calls: Talk as long as you want, even with people in other countries. (Calls are free over Wi-Fi. Otherwise, standard data charges apply.)\n\nEven more ways to message: \nBring your conversations to life with stickers. \nPreview your camera roll photos and videos without leaving the conversation--then choose the perfect ones to send.\nRecord voice messages when you have more to say.\n\nExtra features:\nKnow when people have seen your messages.\nForward messages or photos to people who weren't in the conversation.\nSearch for people and groups to quickly get back to them.\nTurn on location to let people know when you're nearby.\nSee who's available on Messenger and who's active on Facebook. \nTurn off notifications when you're working, sleeping or just need a break.\nStay logged in so you never miss a message."
